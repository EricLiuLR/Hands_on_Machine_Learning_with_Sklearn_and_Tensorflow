    "- Insufficient quantity of training data: machine learning algorithms, including fairly simple ones, performs almost identically well on a complex problem once they got enough data\n",
    "- Non-representative training data: sampling errors and other\n",
    "- Poor-quality data: training data full of errors, outliers, and noise: if some instances are clearly outliers, it may help to simply discard them or try fixing the errors manually; if some instances are missing a few features, you must decide whether you want to ignore this attribute altogether , ignore these instances, fill in the missing values, or train one model with the feature and one model without it, and so on\n",
    "- Irrelevant features\n",
    "- Overfitting the training data: happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noiseness of the training data\n",
    "- Underfitting the training data"
